##  Project Overview
This repository documents the development of a **Blockchain-Integrated Machine Learning System** designed to detect and record fraudulent transactions.

**Current Submission Status:**
This midterm report covers **Phase 1 (Foundations & Component Learning)**. The repository currently hosts the learning modules for Data Analysis (Week 1) and Solidity Smart Contract development (Week 3), which are the building blocks for the final system.
